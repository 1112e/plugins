##Notes
The majority of these scripts require HexChat 2.9.6 or greater as a lot has changed in that release.

Most scripts will work in Python 2.7 or 3.3+

I recommend my [script](https://github.com/TingPing/plugins/blob/master/HexChat/script.py) script. It allows simply running ```/script install|update|remove SCRIPTNAME.py``` to manage my scripts.
